# Docker Base

This project contains utility scripts that I use for Docker container
interaction.

## Run Container

I use the `run_container.sh` script to start a temporary interactive container
that binds to a local directory and generates files in the host file system. The
secret sauce here is that this script will create a new user in the container
with the same UID and GID as the user running the container. This ensures that
the files generated by the container on the host file system are owned by the
host user.

### Usage

`./run_container.sh <image_name> --volume-path <host directory>`

### Issues

The user adding functionality of this script causes the container to start
without a shell. Run `/bin/bash` at start-up.
